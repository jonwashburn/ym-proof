# CRITICAL RECOVERY PLAN

## üö® URGENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**Problem**: The merge with main branch introduced 43 sorries and 1 axiom declaration, violating our mathematical integrity requirements.

**Root Cause**: The main branch had regressed from the clean state at commit b8c4c66 (1 sorry) to a state with 43+ sorries.

## üìä Status Comparison

| State | Sorries | Axioms | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Commit b8c4c66 | 1 | 0 | ‚úÖ Clean (our starting point) |
| Main branch (dcdf6fb) | 43+ | 1 | ‚ùå Regressed |
| Current HEAD (96bb7b6) | 43+ | 1 | ‚ùå Compromised |

## üéØ Recovery Strategy

### Option A: Reset and Reapply (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Reset main to b8c4c66** (clean state)
2. **Apply our build fixes** (lakefile, Stage4, cleanup)  
3. **Fix the single remaining sorry** (gauge_lattice_balances)
4. **Force push to restore integrity**

### Option B: Selective Revert
1. Identify commits that introduced sorries
2. Revert those commits individually
3. Risk: Complex merge conflicts, potential for missing sorries

## üîß Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Reset to Clean State
```bash
git reset --hard b8c4c66
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Phase 2: Reapply Build Fixes
- Unified lakefile configuration
- Stage4_ContinuumLimit creation
- Hidden file cleanup
- Import path standardization

### Phase 3: Complete Mathematical Proof
- Fix gauge_lattice_balances sorry
- Verify 0 sorries, 0 axioms
- Final verification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

**Pros of Option A:**
- Guarantees mathematical integrity
- Clean, traceable history
- Preserves all our build improvements
- Aligns with user's integrity requirements

**Cons of Option A:**
- Requires force push (overwrites main branch)
- Loses intermediate commits (but they contained sorries)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Get user approval for force push approach
2. Execute reset to b8c4c66
3. Reapply our build fixes
4. Complete the proof with mathematical integrity

**Mathematical integrity must be preserved at all costs.**
