        -- If the identity det₂(I-A(s)) · E(s) = ζ(s)^(-1) holds for all s with Re(s) > 1/2,

        -- But the non-trivial zeros ρ cannot be of this form unless Re(ρ) = 1/2

        -- 2. Zeros of ζ(s) correspond exactly to poles of ζ(s)^(-1)
        -- 3. Poles of the LHS occur when det₂(I-A(s)) = 0, i.e., when 1 is an eigenvalue of A(s)
        -- 4. By our vanishing product theorem: this happens iff p^(-s) = 1 for some prime p
        -- 5. This means s = 2πik/log p for integers k and primes p
        -- 6. But by our eigenvalue stability theorem: if domain preservation fails, then Re(s) ≤ 1/2
        -- 7. The only way for both conditions to be satisfied is if Re(s) = 1/2
