# Analysis of Sorry Statements in DiagonalArithmeticHamiltonian.lean

## Summary

Working on just ONE file with 2 sorry statements revealed:

### Sorry #1: `hamiltonian_diagonal_action`
- **Complexity**: Low-Medium
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Files created**: 1 (DiagonalArithmeticHamiltonianProof1.lean)
- **Lines of proof**: ~80 lines
- **Key challenges**:
  - Understanding lp.single behavior in Mathlib
  - Connecting DiagonalOperator definition to deltaBasis
  - Proving extensional equality of functions

### Sorry #2: `hamiltonian_self_adjoint`  
- **Complexity**: High
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED (introduced new sorry)
- **Files created**: 1 (DiagonalArithmeticHamiltonianProof2Simple.lean)
- **Lines of proof**: ~90 lines
- **Key challenges**:
  - Summability/convergence of infinite series
  - Domain conditions and their implications
  - Cauchy-Schwarz inequality application
  - Inner product properties on l² spaces

## Discoveries

1. **Proof Decomposition Creates More Files**: 
   - 1 file with 2 sorries → 3 files total
   - Each sorry can spawn 1-3 helper files

2. **Technical Debt Cascade**:
   - Attempting to prove sorry #2 introduced ANOTHER sorry about summability
   - This suggests each sorry might hide 2-3 additional sub-sorries

3. **Estimated Full Resolution**:
   - 14 total sorries across 7 files
   - Estimated files after full resolution: 30-50 files
   - Estimated total lines of proof: 2,000-4,000 lines

4. **Complexity Distribution**:
   - ~30% are "simple" (like sorry #1): Direct applications of definitions
   - ~50% are "medium": Require 2-3 technical lemmas
   - ~20% are "hard": Involve deep mathematical content (convergence, analysis)

## Infrastructure Sorries by Category

### Category 1: Definition Unwinding (Low complexity)
- DiagonalArithmeticHamiltonian.lean: line 34
- FredholmDeterminant.lean: line 62
- DiagonalOperatorComponents.lean: (none - already complete)

### Category 2: Basic Analysis (Medium complexity)  
- FredholmDeterminant.lean: lines 40, 51
- PrimeRatioNotUnity.lean: lines 37, 42
- DiagonalArithmeticHamiltonian.lean: line 46

### Category 3: Deep Mathematics (High complexity)
- EigenvalueStabilityComplete.lean: line 48 (prime number theorem)
- DeterminantIdentityCompletion.lean: line 53 (Euler product)
- FredholmVanishingEigenvalue.lean: line 56 (infinite products)
- DeterminantProofsFinal.lean: lines 19, 25, 30, 35 (core determinant theory)

## Conclusion

The "complete" proof is approximately 20-25% done. While the architecture is sound, 
each sorry represents significant mathematical work. A realistic completion would require:
- 3-5x more files
- 10-20x more lines of code  
- Substantial mathematical development in:
  - Convergence theory
  - Prime number estimates
  - Complex analysis
  - Operator theory
