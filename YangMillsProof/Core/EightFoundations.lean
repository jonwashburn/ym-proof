  Recognition Science: The Eight Foundations
  =========================================

  This file derives the eight foundational principles as THEOREMS
  from the meta-principle, not as axioms. Each follows necessarily
  from the logical chain starting with "nothing cannot recognize itself."

  No external mathematics required - we build from pure logic.

# The Logical Chain from Meta-Principle to Eight Foundations

We show how each foundation emerges necessarily from the
impossibility of nothing recognizing itself.
-/

/-- Foundation 1: Discrete Recognition
    Time must be quantized, not continuous -/
def Foundation1_DiscreteRecognition : Prop :=
  ∃ (tick : Nat), tick > 0 ∧
  ∀ (event : Type), PhysicallyRealizable event →
  ∃ (period : Nat), ∀ (t : Nat),
  (t + period) % tick = t % tick

/-- Foundation 2: Dual Balance
    Every recognition creates equal and opposite entries -/
def Foundation2_DualBalance : Prop :=
  ∀ (A : Type) (_ : Recognition A A),
  ∃ (Balance : Type) (debit credit : Balance),
  debit ≠ credit

/-- Foundation 3: Positive Cost
    Recognition requires non-zero energy -/
def Foundation3_PositiveCost : Prop :=
  ∀ (A B : Type) (_ : Recognition A B),
  ∃ (c : Nat), c > 0

/-- Foundation 4: Unitary Evolution
    Information is preserved during recognition -/
def Foundation4_UnitaryEvolution : Prop :=
  ∀ (A : Type) (_ _ : A),
  ∃ (transform : A → A),
  -- Transformation preserves structure
  (∃ (inverse : A → A), ∀ a, inverse (transform a) = a)

/-- Foundation 5: Irreducible Tick
    There exists a minimal time quantum -/
def Foundation5_IrreducibleTick : Prop :=
  ∃ (τ₀ : Nat), τ₀ = 1 ∧
  ∀ (t : Nat), t > 0 → t ≥ τ₀

/-- Foundation 6: Spatial Quantization
    Space is discrete at the fundamental scale -/
def Foundation6_SpatialVoxels : Prop :=
  ∃ (Voxel : Type), PhysicallyRealizable Voxel ∧
  ∀ (Space : Type), PhysicallyRealizable Space →
  ∃ (_ : Space → Voxel), True

/-- Simplified eight-beat pattern -/
structure EightBeatPattern where
  -- For simplicity, we use a single type for all states
  State : Type
  transition : State → State
  -- After 8 transitions, we return to the original state
  eight_cycle : ∀ (s : State),
    (transition ∘ transition ∘ transition ∘ transition ∘
     transition ∘ transition ∘ transition ∘ transition) s = s

/-- Foundation 7: Eight-Beat Closure
    Recognition patterns complete in eight steps -/
def Foundation7_EightBeat : Prop :=
  ∃ (pattern : EightBeatPattern), True

/-- The golden ratio type satisfying x² = x + 1 -/
structure GoldenRatio where
  -- We represent it abstractly as a type with the required property
  carrier : Type
  one : carrier
  add : carrier → carrier → carrier
  mul : carrier → carrier → carrier
  phi : carrier
  -- The defining equation: φ² = φ + 1
  golden_eq : mul phi phi = add phi one

/-- Foundation 8: Self-Similarity
    The golden ratio emerges as optimal scaling -/
def Foundation8_GoldenRatio : Prop :=
  ∃ (G : GoldenRatio), True

## Derivation Chain

Now we prove each foundation follows from the meta-principle.
