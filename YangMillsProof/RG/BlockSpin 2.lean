  Block–Spin Coarse-Graining (Scaffold)
  ====================================
  This file sets up the types, constants and statement of the key lemma
  `block_spin_gap_bound` promised in ROADMAP.md.  Stubs are gradually replaced
  by full proofs following the detailed plan.

/-! ## Lattice gauge fields at spacing `a` -/

/--  Minimal type alias for now – eventually should store link variables.
    The parameter `a : ℝ` is the lattice spacing. -/

def trivialField (a : ℝ) : LatticeGaugeField a := ⟨()⟩

/-! ## Block–spin transform -/

/--  Coarse-graining by an integer factor `L ≥ 2`.  For now it just returns a
    trivial field so that the function type is compiled. -/

/-  SU(3) group (to be replaced by proper matrix group). -/
abbrev SU3 : Type := Unit

/- A directed lattice link – fully specified later. -/
abbrev Link : Type := Unit

/-  Simple stand-in: assign to each pair of fields a single plaquette angle θ(U,V)
    and measure energy via `1 - cos θ`.  We pick θ := a (so that the energy
    scales like a² for small lattice spacing, matching perturbation theory).
    This lets us invoke `Wilson/LedgerBridge.cos_bound` to get a quadratic upper
    bound.  The choice is entirely illustrative; the real implementation will
    compute θ from the product of four SU(3) links. -/
