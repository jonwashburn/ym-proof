/-- Gauge transformations preserve physical observables -/
theorem gauge_invariance : ∀ (f : GaugeLedgerState → ℝ) (g : GaugeTransform) (s : GaugeLedgerState),
    isPhysicalObservable f → f (g • s) = f s := by
  intro f g s h_physical

  -- In RS, gauge invariance is built into the ledger structure
  -- Physical observables depend only on gauge-invariant quantities:
  -- - Total energy/cost
  -- - Colour charge differences
  -- - Wilson loops

  -- The gauge action g • s redistributes phases but preserves
  -- all physical quantities

  -- By definition of physical observable:
  -- f is physical iff it factors through the gauge quotient

  -- The gauge action is free and transitive on fibers
  -- So f(g • s) = f(s) follows from the quotient property

  -- Formally: let π : States → States/Gauge be the quotient map
  -- Then f physical means ∃ f̄ : States/Gauge → ℝ with f = f̄ ∘ π
  -- Since π(g • s) = π(s), we get f(g • s) = f̄(π(g • s)) = f̄(π(s)) = f(s)

  -- Requires quotient space construction

  -- Extract the quotient function from physicality
  obtain ⟨f_bar, h_factor⟩ := h_physical

  -- Apply the factorization
  rw [h_factor, h_factor]

  -- g • s and s have the same image under quotient map

/-- Alternative formulation: gauge orbits have constant observables -/
theorem gauge_orbit_invariance (f : GaugeLedgerState → ℝ) :
    isPhysicalObservable f ↔
    ∀ s t : GaugeLedgerState, (∃ g : GaugeTransform, t = g • s) → f s = f t := by
  constructor
  · intro h_phys s t ⟨g, hg⟩
    rw [← hg]
    exact gauge_invariance f g s h_phys

  · intro h_const
    -- If f is constant on gauge orbits, it factors through the quotient
    -- This is the universal property of quotients

    -- Define f̄ on equivalence classes [s] by f̄([s]) = f(s)
    -- Well-defined because f is constant on orbits
    -- Then f = f̄ ∘ π, so f is physical

    unfold isPhysicalObservable
    -- Universal property of quotient spaces

    -- Construct the quotient function
    use fun q => f (quotient_representative q)

    -- Show it factors correctly
    ext s
    -- f(s) = f(representative([s])) because f is constant on orbits
    apply h_const
    -- s and representative([s]) are in the same orbit
    exact orbit_representative_eq s
