# Scaffolding Status

All 7 essential theorem implementations from ROADMAP.md have been scaffolded:

## Created Files

1. **RG/BlockSpin.lean** ✅
   - Defined `LatticeGaugeField`, `blockSpin` transform
   - Stated `block_spin_gap_bound` theorem
   - All proofs marked `sorry`

2. **Measure/ReflectionPositivity.lean** ✅ (was empty, now scaffolded)
   - Defined θ reflection operator, cylinder functions
   - Stated `reflection_positive` theorem  
   - Set up north/south lattice decomposition

3. **Stage3_OSReconstruction/ContinuumReconstruction.lean** ✅
   - Created OS data structure
   - Defined physical Hilbert space construction
   - Listed all Wightman axioms W0-W5
   - Main theorems: `isYangMillsHamiltonian`, `satisfiesWightmanAxioms`

4. **Stage2_LatticeTheory/TransferMatrixGap.lean** ✅
   - Created directory and file
   - Defined time-slice configs, transfer matrix
   - Stated spectral gap theorems
   - Main result: `transfer_matrix_gap_exists`

5. **Topology/ChernWhitney.lean** ✅ (was empty, now scaffolded)
   - Set up SU(3) bundle on T⁴
   - Defined cohomology structures
   - Main theorem: `centre_charge_73` proving defect charge = 73

6. **RG/ContinuumLimit.lean** ✅ (was empty, now scaffolded)
   - Defined `gapScaling` (placeholder = 1)
   - Set up Cauchy sequence proof structure
   - Main theorem: `continuum_gap_exists`

7. **RG/StepScaling.lean** ✅ (was empty, now scaffolded)
   - Defined β-function coefficients b₀, b₁
   - Set up running coupling ODE solution
   - Stated bounds: `c_i_bound`, `c_product_bound`
   - Main result: `physical_gap_value`

## Next Steps

With all scaffolds in place, the implementation phase can begin:
- Replace placeholder definitions with actual formulas
- Fill in `sorry` proofs following the detailed walkthroughs in ROADMAP.md
- Connect the pieces so they import and reference each other correctly

## Building

None of these files are imported into the main build yet, so `lake build` 
continues to succeed. Once implementations are complete, they should be 
imported into the appropriate Stage files.
