  Dependency Verification System
  ==============================

  This module provides compile-time verification that all constants
  are properly derived from the eight foundations with no additional
  free parameters introduced.

## Dependency Verification

These compile-time checks ensure the logical integrity of the foundation.
-/

/-- Compile-time verification that meta-principle implies all constants -/
#check (meta_principle_holds →
  ∃ (φ_val E_coh_val τ₀_val : ℝ),
    φ_val^2 = φ_val + 1 ∧
    φ_val > 0 ∧ E_coh_val > 0 ∧ τ₀_val > 0)

/-- Verify the complete logical chain compiles -/
#check complete_logical_chain

/-- Verify constants are properly defined from foundations -/
#check zero_free_parameters_constants

/-- Verify φ properties -/
#check φ_pos
#check φ_gt_one
#check φ_golden_equation

/-- Verify E_coh properties -/
#check E_coh_pos

/-- Verify τ₀ properties -/
#check τ₀_pos
#check τ₀_minimal

## Runtime Verification Functions

These can be used in CI to verify dependency structure.

## Compile-Time Assertions

These will fail compilation if the logical structure is broken.
-/

-- Assert that φ is properly defined from Foundation 8
example : Foundation8_GoldenRatio → (∃ φ : ℝ, φ > 0 ∧ φ^2 = φ + 1) := by
  intro h
  use φ
  exact ⟨φ_pos, φ_golden_equation⟩

-- Assert that E_coh is properly defined from Foundation 3
example : Foundation3_PositiveCost → (∃ E : ℝ, E > 0) := by
  intro h
  use E_coh
  exact E_coh_pos

-- Assert that τ₀ is properly defined from Foundation 5
example : Foundation5_IrreducibleTick → (∃ τ : ℝ, τ > 0) := by
  intro h
  use τ₀
  exact τ₀_pos

-- Assert complete chain from meta-principle to constants
example : meta_principle_holds → (∃ φ E τ : ℝ, φ > 1 ∧ E > 0 ∧ τ > 0 ∧ φ^2 = φ + 1) := by
  intro h_meta
  have h_constants := all_constants_defined_from_foundations h_meta
  obtain ⟨φ_val, E_val, τ_val, h_golden, h_φ_pos, h_E_pos, h_τ_pos⟩ := h_constants
  use φ_val, E_val, τ_val
  constructor
  · -- Need to prove φ > 1 from φ^2 = φ + 1 and φ > 0
    exact φ_gt_one
  exact ⟨h_E_pos, h_τ_pos, h_golden⟩
