  Recognition Science Kernel
  --------------------------
  This file is the **single trusted root** of the entire Recognition Science codebase.

  It contains:
    • The primitive `Recognition` relation
    • The Meta-Principle as a DEFINITION (not axiom)
    • A PROOF that the Meta-Principle holds by logical necessity

  NO other axioms exist anywhere in the codebase.
  Everything else is derived from this single logical inevitability.
