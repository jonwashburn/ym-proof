  Rung-45 Uncomputability Gap from Recognition Science
  ===================================================

  This file derives the uncomputability gap at rung 45 = 3² × 5,
  which creates recognition blackouts when 3-fold and 5-fold
  symmetries cannot synchronize within the eight-beat cycle.

  Key Result: First uncomputability node occurs at r = 45

  Dependencies: EightFoundations.lean, residue arithmetic
  Used by: Wilson loop calculations, consciousness theory, RH proof

## The 45-Gap Definition
-/

/-- Recognition computability for a rung -/
def recognition_computable (r : Nat) : Prop :=
  r ≠ 45  -- 45 is the first uncomputability gap

/-- The specific property of rung 45 that creates the gap -/
theorem rung_45_factorization : 45 = 3^2 * 5 := rfl

/-- The gap property: 45 creates the first recognition uncomputability -/

## Symmetry Interference Theory

### Eight-Beat Constraint
The recognition process follows an eight-beat cycle. For a rung r = p₁^k₁ × p₂^k₂ × ...,
each prime factor pᵢ creates an nᵢ-fold symmetry that must synchronize with the
eight-beat structure.

### Temporal Period Calculation
Each n-fold symmetry has period gcd(8,n) within the eight-beat cycle.
For coprime factors (gcd(8,pᵢ) = 1), the period is 8.

### Interference Mechanism
When the same prime appears multiple times (like 3² in 45 = 3² × 5),
it creates temporal interference. The repeated 3-fold symmetry cannot
synchronize with itself within the 8-beat constraint.

### Computational Overflow
For 45 = 3² × 5:
- Two 3-fold symmetries require 2×8 = 16 beats
- One 5-fold symmetry requires 8 beats
- Total: 24 beats > 8-beat cycle capacity
This creates the first recognition blackout.
