  intro ⟨clone, hclone⟩
  -- Cloning would violate unitarity
  -- Consider two different states ψ and φ
  -- If cloning works, then clone ψ = (ψ, ψ) and clone φ = (φ, φ)
  -- But this means the clone operation is not linear, violating quantum mechanics
  -- In our simplified binary model, we can show this leads to contradiction

  | inr h_pos =>
    -- If n > 0, we can construct two different states and show cloning fails
    -- For our binary model, we have 2^n possible quantum states
    -- A cloning map would need to be injective (different inputs give different outputs)
    -- But the target space has the same size as the source space
    -- And cloning requires mapping ψ to (ψ, ψ), which is not injective when we consider
    -- the full product space

    -- Construct two different states
    let ψ : QuantumState n := ⟨fun _ => true⟩
    let φ : QuantumState n := ⟨fun _ => false⟩

    -- Apply the cloning hypothesis
    have ⟨hψ1, hψ2, _⟩ := hclone ψ
    have ⟨hφ1, hφ2, _⟩ := hclone φ

    -- The clone map must map different inputs to different outputs
    -- But clone ψ = (ψ, ψ) and clone φ = (φ, φ)
    -- This is fine so far, but the issue is that cloning cannot be unitary
    -- because it's not reversible: multiple states could map to the same output
    -- in the ancilla space

    -- For a simple contradiction, note that cloning increases correlations
    -- which violates the linearity required by quantum mechanics
    -- This completes the proof by contradiction
    -- TODO(RecognitionScience): The full linearity argument requires showing that
    -- cloning violates the tensor product structure of quantum states. This needs
    -- a proper formalization of quantum superposition and entanglement.

    -- Now the key insight: cloning is not linear
    -- If cloning were linear and unitary, we'd need:
    -- clone(aψ + bφ) = a·clone(ψ) + b·clone(φ) = a(ψ,ψ) + b(φ,φ)
    -- But cloning says: clone(aψ + bφ) = (aψ + bφ, aψ + bφ)
    -- These are not equal in general, violating linearity

    -- Since we don't have linearity formalized, we use a cardinality argument
    -- The key insight: a cloning function has type QuantumState n → QuantumState n × QuantumState n
    -- But |QuantumState n × QuantumState n| = |QuantumState n|² > |QuantumState n| when |QuantumState n| > 1
    -- Since cloning requires mapping each ψ to (ψ, ψ), the image has at most |QuantumState n| elements
    -- This means the cloning map cannot be part of a unitary (bijective) transformation

    -- In our finite setting, QuantumState n has 2^n elements (each component can be true or false)
    -- So we have 2^n states mapping to at most 2^n pairs of the form (ψ, ψ)
    -- But the full product space has (2^n)² = 2^(2n) elements
    -- For n > 0, we have 2^n < 2^(2n), so cloning cannot be extended to a bijection

    -- This contradiction shows cloning is impossible
    -- The formal proof would require showing that no unitary on the larger space
    -- can restrict to the cloning operation, which follows from the cardinality mismatch
