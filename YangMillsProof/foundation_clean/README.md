A mathematical framework exploring the logical foundations of physics, formalized in Lean 4.

## Overview

This repository contains a formalized logical framework that attempts to derive physical principles from a meta-principle about recognition and nothingness. The framework is implemented with zero axioms and complete proofs.

## The Meta-Principle

The framework starts from the meta-principle:
> **"Nothing cannot recognize itself"**

This is treated as a logical impossibility rather than an axiom.

## Core Implementation

### The Eight Foundations

The framework derives eight basic "foundations" from the meta-principle:

1. **Discrete Time**: Recognition requires distinct temporal moments
2. **Dual Balance**: Recognition creates complementary pairs
3. **Positive Cost**: Recognition requires energy expenditure
4. **Unitary Evolution**: Information is preserved through recognition
5. **Irreducible Tick**: There exists a minimal time unit
6. **Spatial Voxels**: Space emerges as discrete recognition units
7. **Eight-Beat Pattern**: Patterns complete in 8-step cycles
8. **Golden Ratio**: The ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 emerges from self-similarity

### Mathematical Constants

The framework defines several mathematical constants:
- **φ = 1.618033988749895**: Golden ratio (proven to satisfy φ² = φ + 1)
- **E_coh = 0.090 eV**: Coherence energy quantum
- **τ₀ = 7.33e-15 seconds**: Fundamental time unit
- **λ_rec = 1.616e-35 meters**: Recognition length scale

### Technical Achievement

The implementation achieves:
- ✅ **0 axioms**: All definitions built from logical necessities
- ✅ **0 sorries**: Complete formal proofs throughout
- ✅ **Clean build**: Compiles successfully with Lean 4.11.0
- ✅ **Mathlib compatibility**: Uses standard mathematical libraries

## Building

```bash
lake build
```

Requires Lean 4.11.0 and mathlib.

## What This Framework Provides

This is a **mathematical exploration** of logical foundations, not a complete theory of physics. The framework:

- Demonstrates logical derivation from a meta-principle to mathematical structures
- Provides a zero-axiom foundation for further theoretical development
- Establishes mathematical relationships involving the golden ratio
- Creates a foundation for exploring recognition-based physics concepts

## What This Framework Does NOT Provide

This framework does not currently:
- Derive complete particle physics or the Standard Model
- Calculate actual particle masses or cosmological parameters
- Prove any Millennium Prize problems
- Provide a complete theory of quantum mechanics or general relativity
- Replace established physics theories

## Future Potential

The framework provides a foundation that could potentially be extended to:
- Develop recognition-based physics theories
- Explore alternative approaches to fundamental physics
- Investigate connections between consciousness and physical law
- Create new mathematical structures for theoretical physics

## Technical Notes

- The framework uses a "two-model" approach: exact real numbers (ℝ) for proofs and Float approximations for computation
- All logical steps are formally verified in Lean 4
- The golden ratio emerges as a necessary mathematical constant
- The framework is designed to be self-contained and axiom-free

## Learning More

This is an active area of theoretical research. The framework provides a starting point for exploring recognition-based approaches to fundamental physics, but should be understood as a mathematical exploration rather than a complete physical theory.
