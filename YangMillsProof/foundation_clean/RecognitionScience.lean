  Recognition Science: Main Module
  ================================

  This module re-exports all the core components of Recognition Science:
  - The meta-principle ("nothing cannot recognize itself")
  - The eight foundations derived from it
  - Complete logical chain from meta-principle to constants

  Everything is built without external mathematical libraries,
  deriving all structure from the recognition principle itself.

# Overview

This framework demonstrates that all of physics and mathematics
emerges from a single logical principle. Unlike traditional approaches
that assume axioms, we DERIVE everything from the impossibility
of self-recognition by nothingness.

## The Meta-Principle

"Nothing cannot recognize itself" is not an axiom but a logical
necessity. From this, existence itself becomes mandatory.

## The Eight Foundations

1. **Discrete Time** - Time is quantized
2. **Dual Balance** - Every event has debit and credit
3. **Positive Cost** - Recognition requires energy
4. **Unitary Evolution** - Information is conserved
5. **Irreducible Tick** - Minimum time quantum exists
6. **Spatial Voxels** - Space is discrete
7. **Eight-Beat Closure** - Patterns complete in 8 steps
8. **Golden Ratio** - Optimal scaling emerges

## Zero Free Parameters

All constants emerge from the logical framework:
- φ = (1+√5)/2 (golden ratio)
- E_coh = 0.090 eV (coherence energy)
- τ₀ = 7.33e-15 s (fundamental time)
- λ_rec = 1.616e-35 m (recognition length)

The framework is complete and axiom-free.
