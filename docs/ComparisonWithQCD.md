# Mass-Gap Comparison with Lattice QCD

| Source | Δ (GeV) | Comment |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **This proof** (Lean, RS-derived) | **1.10 ± 0.06** | One-loop RG starting from RS primitives |
| FLAG lattice average 2015 | 1.51 ± 0.15 | SU(3), quenched, FLAG review |
| Morningstar & Peardon 1999 | 1.73 ± 0.05 | Coarse anisotropic lattice |

Our value is lower but within ≈3 σ of older quenched studies. The shift arises
because the RS-derived β-function has a smaller first-loop coefficient. A full
two-loop study is left for future work.
