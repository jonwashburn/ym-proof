Matrix → Transfer adapter (noninvasive).

We package a concrete matrix as a transfer operator via `Matrix.toLin'`, and
provide an adapter that turns a matrix-level spectral/PF gap into a
`TransferPFGap` for an abstract `(μ, K)` pair, without modifying shared
interfaces.

Adapter: A spectral gap for the finite-state Markov kernel `K` yields a PF transfer gap
for any abstract `(μ, Kt)` that is intended to be modeled by `K` at the interface level.

At the current interface granularity, `TransferPFGap` is a Prop placeholder, so the adapter
does not need additional structure beyond the spectral gap hypothesis.

Concrete, noninvasive matrix→transfer adapter.

We introduce a lightweight `TransferOp` wrapper that carries a continuous
linear operator on a finite coordinate space `ι → ℂ`, together with an adapter
`matrixToTransferOp` from a finite matrix via `Matrix.toLin'`. We then export a
Prop-level bridge `spectral_to_transfer_gap` that takes a (finite-dimensional)
PF-type spectral gap and returns the pipeline’s `TransferPFGap` without editing
core shared interfaces.

This module is additive to the existing interface: no changes to `ym/Transfer`.

  Finite-dim spectral equivalence note:
  The operator `(Matrix.toLin' A)` and the matrix `A` have the same spectrum and
  spectral data (eigenvalues with algebraic multiplicities). Thus any PF-type
  spectral gap statement for `toLin' A` is equivalent to one for `A` itself.
  We record this equivalence at the Prop level by simply carrying the gap size
  `γ` forward to the transfer layer.

  Assumptions implicitly used (documented):
  - `ι` is finite; linear equivalence between matrices and endomorphisms on `ι → ℂ`.
  - Norms/metrics align so that gap statements transport along `toLin'`.
  - The abstract `TransferKernel` models the same dynamics at the interface.
