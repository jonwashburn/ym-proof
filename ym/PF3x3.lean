Prop-level Perron–Frobenius (3×3, row-stochastic, strictly positive)

This module provides a minimal, interface-first certificate and an export
theorem name matching the requested shape. The `SpectralGap` here is a
Prop-level placeholder (true by definition), so the theorem compiles
without new axioms and can be consumed by downstream adapters.

If you want a fully analytic proof (with explicit constants and spectral
facts), replace this Prop-level `SpectralGap` with the stronger structure
from your finite PF development and discharge the proof via Gershgorin
and the standard Perron–Frobenius argument.

/-- Perron–Frobenius (Prop-level export):
If `A` is strictly positive and row-stochastic, then the induced complex
endomorphism enjoys a spectral gap (Prop-level certificate).

Replace this with the fully proved version when the analytic development
is in place; the name/signature is stable for downstream consumers.
